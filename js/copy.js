		description: '<br />You may have heard of CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas9. The name comes from the CRISPR system in bacteria, where it was first discovered. There, it functions as a type of immune system. Scientists have modified the bacterial system to produce a biotechnology tool for editing the DNA of different cells and many other applications. Explore this dynamic interactive to learn the basic principles of how this revolutionary tool works and the many ways in which scientists are using it in their research.<br /><br />The <span class="pink-button">How It Works</span> view shows the molecular details of the most common application of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool: cleaving and editing DNA at a precise location, using a human cell as an example. The <span class="pink-button">How It’s Used</span> view consists of short interviews with scientists who are using this tool in a variety of ways, not just to inactivate or edit genes, but also to turn on gene expression, label DNA, or even change the chemistry of specific nucleotides.',

		description: '<br />Since it was first described in 2012, CRISPR-Cas9 (often shortened to “CRISPR”) has generated much interest both for its exciting potential for treating genetic disease as well as for potential ethical and safety concerns, such as creating “designer babies” and “superhumans.” So far, CRISPR-based technologies are having the biggest impact in research laboratories where they are applied in a broad range of biological studies. The technology is relatively cheap, easy to use, and allows researchers to ask new questions and get results faster than previously possible.<br /><br />' +
		'The <i>CRISPR-Cas9: Mechanism & Applications</i> interactive allows students to explore and learn about this biotechnology tool that is at the forefront of scientific research and hear directly from leading researchers about how they use CRISPR. It consists of a self-paced interactive animation (<span class="pink-button">How It Works</span>) and a series of short videos of different scientists who are using CRISPR for basic research, medical, and agricultural applications (<span class="pink-button">How It’s Used</span>).<br /><br />' +
		'With the self-paced interactive animation, students can: <br /> ' + 
		'<ul>' +
		'<li>explore the 3D structure and function of the Cas9 enzyme (a nuclease that cleaves double-stranded DNA);</li>' +
		'<li>see how proteins “scan” the genome and recognize specific DNA sequences;</li>' +
		'<li>examine the complementary base pairing that occurs between the guide RNA and target DNA sequence; and</li>' +
		'<li>get introduced to or review the cellular DNA repair mechanisms (non-homologous end joining and homology-directed repair).</li>' +
		'</ul>' +
		'Through the videos, students can:<br />' + 
		'<ul>' + 
		'<li>explore and learn about different areas of research and</li>' +
		'<li>encounter a diversity of researchers</li>' +
		'</ul>' +
		'<i>CRISPR-Cas9: Mechanism & Applications</i> is designed to be used in a variety of courses, ranging from first-year high school biology, biotechnology-focused courses, undergraduate introductory biology, and various molecular biology electives. <br /><br />' +
		'Throughout the animation and videos, students can more deeply explore additional information in a variety of formats. The “Explore” icons in the animation provide cross-sectional views of the molecules with detailed descriptions of their function. The videos are accompanied by short written summaries of the researchers’ work and include lists of relevant scientific papers. <br /><br />' +
